### Co-Teleological Interaction with AI Agents
An interaction paradigm that emphasizes dynamic collaboration between people and generative AI: through **multi-branch dialogues and reflective iteration** to clarify and refine goals, supporting divergent–convergent creative exploration. Prototype built with GPT-4 and DALL·E show promise in stimulating ideation and multi-perspective dialogue.

### Unity Window Capture for 3D/MR
A Unity-based tool that captures desktop windows and **projects them onto 3D surfaces**, with basic editing and window management—exploring spatial layout and interaction for mixed-reality workflows. I led core interaction implementation and performance optimization, and coordinated project management and communication; the prototype received positive internal research feedback.
